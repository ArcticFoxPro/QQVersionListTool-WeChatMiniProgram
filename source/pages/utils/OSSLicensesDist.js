The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

These owners may contribute\nto the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further\nproduction of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or\ngreater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of\nothers.\n\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of\nadditional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a\nWork (the “Affirmer”), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright\nand Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and\npublicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal\neffect of CC0 on those rights.\n\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\n   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (“Copyright and\n   Related Rights”). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited\n   to, the following:\n   1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,\n      and translate a Work;\n   2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n   3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person’s image or likeness\n      depicted in a Work;\n   4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;\n   5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in\n      a Work;\n   6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,\n      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n   7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\n      based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations\n      thereof.\n\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,\n   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and\n   unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer’s Copyright\n   and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now\n   known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of\n   action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum\n   duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “Waiver”).

These are expensive interactions and must be avoided whenever possible! Instead, when not in \"dev\" mode, `sirv` performs all its file-system operations upfront and then relies on its cache for future operations.\n\nThis middleware will work out of the box for [Polka](https://github.com/lukeed/polka), Express, and other Express-like frameworks. It will also work with the native `http`, `https` and `http2` modules. It requires _very_ little effort to modify/wrap it for servers that don't accept the `(req, res, next)` signature.\n\n:bulb: For a feature-complete CLI application, check out the sibling [`sirv-cli`](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv/tree/master/packages/sirv-cli) package as an alternative to [`zeit/serve`](https://github.com/zeit/serve)~!\n\n## Install\n\n```\n$ npm install --save sirv\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nconst sirv = require('sirv');\nconst polka = require('polka');\nconst compress = require('compression')();\n\n// Init `sirv` handler\nconst assets = sirv('public', {\n  maxAge: 31536000, // 1Y\n  immutable: true\n});\n\npolka()\n  .use(compress, assets)\n  .use('/api', require('./api'))\n  .listen(3000, err => {\n    if (err) throw err;\n    console.log('> Ready on localhost:3000~!');\n  });\n```\n\n\n## API\n\n### sirv(dir, opts={})\n\nReturns: `Function`\n\nThe returned function is a middleware in the standard Express-like signature: `(req, res, next)`, where `req` is the [`http.IncomingMessage`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage), `res` is the [`http.ServerResponse`](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v9.x/docs/api/http.html#http_class_http_serverresponse), and `next` (in this case) is the function to call if no file was found for the given path.\n\nWhen defined, a `next()` callback is always called _instead of_ the [`opts.onNoMatch`](#optsonnomatch) callback. However, unlike `onNoMatch`, your `next()` is given no arguments.\n\n#### dir\nType: `String`<br>\nDefault: `.`\n\nThe directory from which to read and serve assets. It is resolved to an absolute path &mdash; you must provide an absolute path yourself if `process.cwd()` is not the correct assumption.\n\n#### opts.dev\nType: `Boolean`<br>\nDefault: `false`\n\nEnable \"dev\" mode, which disables/skips caching. Instead, `sirv` will traverse the file system ***on every request***.\n\nAdditionally, `dev` mode will ignore `maxAge` and `immutable` as these options generate a production-oriented `Cache-Control` header value.\n\n> **Important:** Do not use `dev` mode in production!\n\n#### opts.etag\nType: `Boolean`<br>\nDefault: `false`\n\nGenerate and attach an `ETag` header to responses.\n\n> **Note:** If an incoming request's [`If-None-Match` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/If-None-Match) matches the `ETag` value, a `304` response is given.\n\n#### opts.dotfiles\nType: `Boolean`<br>\nDefault: `false`\n\nAllow requests to dotfiles (files or directories beginning with a `.`).\n\n> **Note:** Requests to [`/.well-known/*`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8615) are always allowed.\n\n#### opts.extensions\nType: `Array<String>`<br>\nDefault: `['html', 'htm']`\n\nThe file extension fallbacks to check for if a pathame is not initially found. For example, if a `/login` request cannot find a `login` filename, it will then look for `login.html` and `login.htm` before giving up~!\n\n> **Important:** Actually, `sirv` will **also** look for `login/index.html` and `login/index.htm` before giving up.\n\n#### opts.gzip\nType: `Boolean`<br>\nDefault: `false`\n\nDetermine if `sirv` look for **precompiled** `*.gz` files.<br>\nMust be enabled _and_ the incoming request's [`Accept Encoding`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Encoding) must include \"gzip\" in order for `sirv` to search for the gzip'd alternative.\n\n> **Note:** The `.gz` assumption also applies to the `opts.extensions` list.\n\n```js\n// NOTE: PSEUDO CODE\n// Showing lookup logic\n\n// Request: [Accept-Encoding: gzip] \"/foobar.jpg\"\nlookup([\n  '/foobar.jpg.gz', '/foobar.jpg',\n  '/foobar.jpg.html.gz', '/foobar.jpg/index.html.gz',\n  '/foobar.jpg.htm.gz', '/foobar.jpg/index.htm.gz',\n  '/foobar.jpg.html', '/foobar.jpg/index.html',\n  '/foobar.jpg.htm', '/foobar.jpg/index.htm',\n]);\n\n// Request: [Accept-Encoding: gzip] \"/\"\nlookup([\n  '/index.html.gz',\n  '/index.htm.gz',\n  '/index.html',\n  '/index.htm',\n]);\n```\n\n\n#### opts.brotli\nType: `Boolean`<br>\nDefault: `false`\n\nDetermine if `sirv` look for **precompiled** `*.br` files.<br>\nMust be enabled _and_ the incoming request's [`Accept Encoding`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Encoding) must include either \"br\" or \"brotli\" in order for `sirv` to search for the brotli-compressed alternative.\n\n> **Note:** The `.br` assumption also applies to the `opts.extensions` list.\n\nWhen both `opts.broli` and `opts.gzip` are enabled &mdash; and all conditions are equal &mdash; then the brotli variant always takes priority.\n\n```js\n// NOTE: PSEUDO CODE\n// Showing lookup logic\n\n// Request: [Accept-Encoding: br] \"/foobar.jpg\"\nlookup([\n  '/foobar.jpg.br', '/foobar.jpg',\n  '/foobar.jpg.html.br', '/foobar.jpg/index.html.br',\n  '/foobar.jpg.htm.br', '/foobar.jpg/index.htm.br',\n  '/foobar.jpg.html', '/foobar.jpg/index.html',\n  '/foobar.jpg.htm', '/foobar.jpg/index.htm',\n]);\n\n// Request: [Accept-Encoding: br,gz] \"/\"\nlookup([\n  '/index.html.br'\n  '/index.htm.br'\n  '/index.html.gz'\n  '/index.htm.gz'\n  '/index.html'\n  '/index.htm'\n]);\n```\n\n#### opts.maxAge\nType: `Number`<br>\nDefault: `undefined`\n\nEnables the `Cache-Control` header on responses and sets the `max-age` value (in seconds).<br>\nFor example, `maxAge: 31536000` is equivalent to one year.\n\n#### opts.immutable\nType: `Boolean`<br>\nDefault: `false`\n\nAppends the [`immutable` directive](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control#Revalidation_and_reloading) on your `Cache-Control` header, used for uniquely-named assets that will not change!\n\n> **Important:** Will only work if `opts.maxAge` has a value defined!\n\n#### opts.single\nType: `Boolean` or `String`<br>\nDefault: `false`\n\nTreat the directory as a single-page application.\n\nWhen `true`, the directory's index page (default `index.html`) will be sent if the request asset does not exist.<br>\nYou may pass a `string` value to use a file _instead of_ `index.html` as your fallback.\n\nFor example, if \"/about\" is requested but no variants of that file exist, then the response for \"/\" is sent instead:\n\n```js\n// Note: This is psuedo code to illustrate what's happening\n\n// Request: \"/about\"\nlet file = find(['/about', '/about.html', '/about.htm', '/about/index.html', '/about.htm']);\nif (file) {\n  send(file);\n} else if (opts.single === true) {\n  file = find(['/', '/index.html', '/index.htm']);\n  send(file);\n} else if (typeof opts.single === 'string') {\n  file = find([opts.single]);\n  send(file);\n} else {\n  // next() or 404\n}\n```\n\n#### opts.ignores\nType: `false` or `Array<String | RegExp>`\n\nSpecify paths/patterns that should ignore the fallback behavior that `opts.single` provides.\n\nBy default, any asset-like path (URLs that end with an extension) will be ignored. This means that, for example, if `/foobar.jpg` is not found, a `404` response is sent instead of the `index.html` fallback.\n\nAdditionally, any `/.well-known/*` pathname ignores the fallback – as do all other dotfile requests when `opts.dotfiles` is enabled.\n\nAny string value(s) will be passed through `new RegExp(value, 'i')` directly.\n\nFinally, you may set `ignores: false` to disable ***all*** ignores, including the defaults. Put differently, this will fallback ***all*** unknown pathnames to your `index.html` (or custom `opts.single` value).\n\n> **Important:** Only has an effect if `opts.single` is enabled.\n\n#### opts.onNoMatch\nType: `Function`\n\nA custom function to run if a file cannot be found for a given request. <br>By default, `sirv` will send a basic `(404) Not found` response.\n\nThe function receives the current `req <IncomingMessage>, res <ServerResponse>` pair for as its two arguments.\n\n> **Note:** This won't run if a `next` callback has been provided to the middleware; see [`sirv`](#sirvdir-opts) description.\n\n#### opts.setHeaders\nType: `Function`\n\nA custom function to append or change any headers on the outgoing response. There is no default.\n\nIts signature is `(res, pathname, stats)`, where `res` is the `ServerResponse`, `pathname` is incoming request path (stripped of queries), and `stats` is the file's result from [`fs.statSync`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_statsync_path).\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT © [Luke Edwards](https://lukeed.com)",name:"sirv",version:"3.0.0",description:"The optimized & lightweight middleware for serving requests to static assets"},"slide@1.1.6":{licenses:"ISC",repository:"https://github.com/isaacs/slide-flow-control",publisher:"Isaac Z.

For the purposes\n      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\n      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\n      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\n\n      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including\n      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions\n      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally\n      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner\n      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of\n      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"\n      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent\n      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to\n      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,\n      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the\n      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but\n      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise\n      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."\n\n      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity\n      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and\n      subsequently incorporated within the Work.\n\n   2.

Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\n      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\n      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\n      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.
